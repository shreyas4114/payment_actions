‚û°Ô∏è [iac-payment](https://github.com/shreyas4114/iac-payment): Terraform code for setting up the EKS infrastructure.

CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, analyzing, and deploying the `Payment` microservices application to an AWS EKS cluster.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository automates the lifecycle of a multi-component microservices application (React frontend, Node backend, MongoDB) using GitHub Actions. It covers:

- Code checkout and testing
- Static analysis with SonarQube
- Docker image build and push to Amazon ECR
- Kubernetes deployment via Helm on EKS

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Docker**, **Amazon ECR**
- **AWS EKS**, **kubectl**, **Helm**
- **SonarQube** for code quality
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## üîÑ GitHub Actions Workflow

The main workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yaml`) is triggered via **manual dispatch** and consists of three sequential jobs:

1. **Testing**
   - Runs unit tests with Maven
   - Performs static analysis via Checkstyle
   - Runs a SonarQube scan and checks the Quality Gate

2. **Build & Publish**
   - Builds a Docker image
   - Pushes it to Amazon ECR with `latest` and run-specific tags

3. **Deploy to EKS**
   - Configures AWS credentials and kubeconfig
   - Deploys the application using Helm with updated image tags

---

## üîê Required Secrets

To run this workflow, the following GitHub secrets must be configured:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `REGISTRY` (ECR registry URI)
- `SONAR_TOKEN`
- `SONAR_URL`
- `SONAR_ORGANIZATION`
- `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Helm Deployment

The Helm chart is configured to pull the latest Docker image from ECR and deploy all services into the `default` namespace of your EKS cluster.

You can customize values using the `values:` input inside the workflow or by editing chart defaults.
